<h1>Hello world, It`s Breann </h1>
<p> I'm a junior in hiogh school. My favorite class this school year so far is, U.S. history and performing arts. There's others that I like too but I feel like these are going to be my best classes this year. Computer science is fun so far and I've done a class like this before but it was like in the fifth grade. I don't really remember it but I do remember that I did really enjoy it so I'm seeing how this is going to play out. Read on to learn more about me</p>

<h2> What I love about myself </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> The first thing that I love about myself is that I like to see things through. I'm willing to give things a try even if they don`t sound like the most awesome thing in the world. </li>
<li>I'm able to be myself without having the fear of people not liking me </li>
<li> I'm an open minded person. </li>
<li> Im learing to love myself</li>
</ol>
<h2> Things I need to work on </h2>
<ol>
<li> I`m nice to some people even if they haven't been the most polite people to me. Sometimes I like that about myself but sometimes I hate it because what if people use that as a reason to walk all over me. And I personally feel like I may have let them think that it's okay to treat me like a negligible person </li>
</ol>
